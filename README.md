# 484Demo
This repository contains the work done over ENGR484 Senior Capstone Design Project.
First, the Matlab file contains the combination eigenbackground method discussed to obtaine the foreground masked images.
This method was employed on a database from Trinity College's \\tbos\Projects\Smedley ecology dataset gathered in 2015.
The resulting foreground masks created by employed the combination eigenbackground method on various datasets were compiled
into a dropbox folder containing approximately a total of 600 training images for two classes: humans and animals.
Then, a convolutional neural network was built using Python3 and tensorflow using Google Colab. The ipynb notebook can also be
found in this repository.
